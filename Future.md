# HTMX_GO Project Documentation

## Overview
This project is built using **Gin**, **HTMX**, and **MongoDB**. It supports dynamic content rendering (JSON or HTML) based on request headers. Below is a list of additional features that can be added to improve functionality and user experience.

---

## 1. User Roles and Permissions

**Description**:  
Implement different user roles such as `admin`, `user`, and `guest`. This will allow you to control access to certain routes based on the user's role.

**Features**:
- Role-based access control (RBAC).
- Middleware to check user permissions before accessing routes.
- Admin dashboard for user management.

**Implementation**:
- Add a `role` field to the user model.
- Create a middleware that checks the role of the logged-in user before allowing access to specific routes.

---

## 2. Email Verification and Notifications

**Description**:  
Enhance security by requiring users to verify their email address upon registration. Notifications can be sent for events such as password resets and new sign-ups.

**Features**:
- Email verification link sent to users after registration.
- Password reset email.
- Notification emails for specific events (e.g., new login, account changes).

**Implementation**:
- Integrate an email service like SendGrid or Mailgun.
- Add routes for handling email verification and password resets.

---

## 3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**Description**:  
Add an additional layer of security with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Users will be required to enter a one-time code in addition to their password.

**Features**:
- Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) generation.
- QR code generation for setting up 2FA apps (Google Authenticator, Authy).
- SMS-based 2FA.

**Implementation**:
- Use a library like `github.com/pquerna/otp` for TOTP.
- Generate QR codes for 2FA using a package like `go-qrcode`.

---

## 4. Rate Limiting and Throttling

**Description**:  
Prevent abuse and ensure system stability by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a certain time period.

**Features**:
- Limit the number of requests per minute/hour.
- Middleware for tracking request rates per user/IP address.

**Implementation**:
- Use `gin-contrib/limiter` or a similar library.
- Apply rate-limiting middleware to sensitive routes (e.g., login, registration).

---

## 5. Pagination for Large Data Sets

**Description**:  
Implement pagination to efficiently handle large data sets (e.g., lists of users or products) in both JSON and HTML responses.

**Features**:
- Support for pagination in API responses (JSON).
- Pagination controls in HTML templates for list views.

**Implementation**:
- Use MongoDB’s `.Find()` with `Limit` and `Skip` for pagination.
- Add pagination controls in the frontend using HTMX or plain HTML.

---

## 6. Real-Time Features (WebSockets/SSE)

**Description**:  
Add real-time updates to the project for notifications, live data, and chat functionality without refreshing the page.

**Features**:
- Real-time notifications for users.
- WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live data updates.

**Implementation**:
- Implement WebSockets using `github.com/gorilla/websocket`.
- Alternatively, use SSE (Server-Sent Events) for simpler real-time updates.

---

## 7. Search and Filtering

**Description**:  
Enable search and filtering functionality for large datasets, allowing users to quickly find the data they need.

**Features**:
- Full-text search using MongoDB’s `text` index.
- Filter data by specific fields (e.g., user role, date).

**Implementation**:
- Use MongoDB’s `$text` operator for search.
- Implement filtering in MongoDB queries based on user input.

---

## 8. File Upload and Management

**Description**:  
Allow users to upload files such as profile pictures, documents, or other media. Manage file storage efficiently with local storage or cloud services.

**Features**:
- File upload support for images and documents.
- Integration with cloud storage providers (e.g., AWS S3).

**Implementation**:
- Use Gin’s `FormFile()` method to handle file uploads.
- Store files in local storage or integrate with AWS S3 for cloud storage.

---

## 9. API Rate Limiting and API Keys

**Description**:  
Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse and distribute API usage fairly among users. Use API keys for authorized access.

**Features**:
- Rate limiting per API key.
- API key generation for different user accounts.
- API usage tracking.

**Implementation**:
- Implement rate limiting with a package like `gin-contrib/limiter`.
- Generate API keys for users and store them securely in MongoDB.

---

## 10. Logging and Monitoring

**Description**:  
Improve the robustness of your project by adding detailed logging and integrating with monitoring tools to track application performance.

**Features**:
- Request and error logging.
- Real-time performance monitoring.
- Integration with tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

**Implementation**:
- Use `logrus` or another logging library to capture detailed logs.
- Integrate Prometheus for monitoring and visualize metrics with Grafana.

---

## 11. Internationalization (i18n)

**Description**:  
Support multiple languages in both your JSON API responses and HTML templates, making your application accessible to a global audience.

**Features**:
- Translation files for different languages.
- Detect user language via `Accept-Language` headers or user settings.

**Implementation**:
- Use a library like `gin-i18n` to manage translations.
- Create translation files for all supported languages (e.g., `en.json`, `fr.json`).

---

## 12. Social Media Login (OAuth)

**Description**:  
Allow users to log in using their social media accounts (e.g., Google, GitHub, Facebook) via OAuth2, simplifying the registration process.

**Features**:
- OAuth2 login via social media providers.
- Secure token handling and user identity verification.

**Implementation**:
- Use a library like `golang.org/x/oauth2` to implement OAuth2 flows.
- Set up integrations with providers like Google and GitHub.

---

## 13. Testing and CI/CD Integration

**Description**:  
Ensure the reliability of your project by adding unit tests for critical components. Automate testing and deployment using CI/CD pipelines.

**Features**:
- Unit and integration tests for handlers, services, and repositories.
- CI/CD integration for automated testing and deployment.

**Implementation**:
- Use `testing` and `gin-gonic/gin/testdata` for unit tests.
- Set up GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployments.

## 14. API Documentation (Swagger)

**Description**:  
Automatically generate and maintain API documentation using Swagger, making it easy for developers to understand and use your API.

**Features**:
- Auto-generated API documentation in JSON format.
- Interactive API documentation UI for testing endpoints.

**Implementation**:
- Use `swaggo/gin-swagger` to generate Swagger documentation.
- Add Swagger annotations to your API routes.
